### Direct Current Resistivity

Direct current (DC) resistivity surveys are used to obtain information about subsurface electrical
conductivity, which can be a diagnostic physical property in, for example, mineral exploration or
hydrogeologic problems, where the target of interest has a significant electrical conductivity
contrast from the background. In a DC resistivity survey, steady state currents are set up in the
subsurface by injecting current through a positive electrode (located at $r_{s^+}$) and completing
the circuit with a return electrode at ($r_{s^-}$).
