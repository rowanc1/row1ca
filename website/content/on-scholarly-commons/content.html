<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>
    While working on my PhD and some related activities in <a href="/geosci">geoscience education</a> I explored ideas around scientific communication, the current publication process, interactive reproducible figures, collaboration, and combining computation and context. I have recently finished my PhD, and have devoted some time to redesigning my website. I want this to be an experiment to explore some of these ideas in more detail than I was able to during my PhD. The context for this is to look at the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jun/27/profitable-business-scientific-publishing-bad-for-science" target="_blank">very broken publication machine</a> that has entangled itself with scientists, and has put their work behind pay-walls. We pay for the privileged of buying our own work - and if you want to <emph>own</emph> your work or let citizens read it, that costs more. And by we pay, I mean you dear citizen - three times over (1) the scientists salary, (2) for the "volunteers" checking the work, and (3) for the final published product. It just <a href="https://www.force11.org/group/fairgroup/fairprinciples" target="_blank">isn't fair</a>. <ink-aside>FAIR: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Re-usable. The current system maybe gets a $1.2/4$.</ink-aside> So. I am going to make a website, and in a weird convoluted way try to make a point.

    Publishers are now wound so tightly around the various organs of the scientific body that no single effort has been able to dislodge them.

<h2>Dreams</h2>

<p>
    I think it would be totally cool to have a website that is an interactive visualization of all of your work. For the context of this article, your scientific contributions. Currently, your scientific resume is determined by your <emph>h-index</emph>, and not only is mine terrible, getting boiled down to <a href="https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=k8DpDMMAAAAJ&hl=en" target=_blank>a number</a> is both terrifying and <strong>really boring</strong>.
    <ink-aside>
        <ink-figure src="/images/website/github-contributions.png">
            GitHub contributions, but only the ones they determine worthy.
        </ink-figure>
    </ink-aside>
    There are some projects out there (e.g. <a href="https://profiles.impactstory.org/u/0000-0002-7859-8394" target="_blank">impact story</a>) that do a slightly better job of this though alt-metrics. GitHub shows you a dashboard of your coding contributions. However, both of these examples still have the problem that <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/why-are-my-contributions-not-showing-up-on-my-profile/">other people dictate your story</a>. I have worked on a bunch of different things and have threads of ideas that intermittently surface over the years and come together in unique ways - they certainly aren't all on GitHub and about zero are on Facebook if you round up. It would be totally cool to <emph>see</emph> this story - and communicate a slightly richer picture of my influences, ideas, thoughts and projects. I really have no idea what this would look like, but to get to anything sensible, you will need to start by getting data.
</p>

<ink-figure src="/images/website/life.png">
    Not quite sure what good looks like. Maybe a stream graph showing <a href="/projects">all projects</a> broken down by tags.
</ink-figure>


<h2>Start with data</h2>

<p>
    So I have a goal, my website should really show all sorts of things that I am up to, in various streams that has a sense of time, grouping, magnitude. You can zoom into things, drill down, explore. It should obviously be connected to github, slideshare, orcid, twitter, linkedin. A rich visualization needs rich data - and most of the data I actually want to show is hidden away in documents and is not accessible to visualize in other ways. My CV is a perfect example of this, it is written in <code>latex</code>, which at least allows me to comment things out and re-render it without loosing data. However, a PDF is not as interactive as the web, so it is a poor target environment to render to (who prints things anyways...?!). I am going to start with pulling apart the idea of a CV, specifically <a href="/innovative-dissemination-award-simpeg">an award</a> we received for <a href="/simpeg">SimPEG</a>, because it makes sense that this might be a node in the visualization above and should be interacted with as a distinct <emph>thing</emph>. I am going to represent this as <code>JSON</code> and throw a few things inside an object.
</p>

<ink-code>
{
    "__class__": "CvAward",
    "uid": "scholarship-ubc-simpeg",
    "title": "UBC Library Innovative Dissemination of Research Award",
    "description": "Awarded for the SimPEG framework and community development",
    "amount": 1000,
    "level": "institutional",
    "date": "2016/04/08",
    "declined": false,
    "url_more": "/innovative-dissemination-award-simpeg"
}
</ink-code>

<p>
    This needs to be parsed or loaded up by something to transform it into a rendered form. In this case, I have chosen Python to parse the <code>JSON</code> and the <a href="http://propertiespy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">properties</a> library to add structure, type-checking and validation. As you can see in the <code>JSON</code> above, there is a <code>__class__</code> that will determine which python class to load into, which is shown below. Here <code>CvItem</code> inherits from a base class which has the shared pieces like <code>uid</code>, <code>title</code> and <code>description</code>. I am using the properties library to do things like limit the choices of the <code>level</code> of the award to a typo-free subset.
</p>

<ink-code>
class CvAward(CvItem):

    style_item = 'cv-award'

    amount = properties.Float('amount of the award')
    declined = properties.Bool('Award declined?', default=False)

    level = properties.StringChoice(
        'level of the award',
        choices={
            'institutional', 'regional',
            'national', 'international'
        }
    )
</ink-code>

<p>
    It is totally trivial to go from the <code>JSON</code> to deserialize to an instance of this class:
    <br><code>instance = CvAward.deserialize(data)</code><br>
    Other methods can be added to the python class to <code>render</code> this to something more beautiful and readable than <code>JSON</code>!
    <ink-aside>
        I am using <a href="https://github.com/3ptscience/jinja2-registry" target="_blank">Jinja2 Registry</a> to do my rendering, which adds some nice things to Jinja2.
    </ink-aside>
    We can choose <code>html</code> as a render target language or perhaps even <code>latex</code> for that mater if you are making a PDF! Here I have chosen to focus mostly on the <code>html</code> side of things and am using the web components standard and <a href="https://www.polymer-project.org/">Polymer 2.0</a> to modularize these classes into custom DOM elements. The <a href="https://github.com/rowanc1/ink/blob/4fd19fcaabd86d9254482913c5709db2ba957669/cv-award.html" target="_blank"><code>CvAward</code></a> code is on GitHub, in a repository called <a href="https://github.com/rowanc1/ink" target="_blank"><code>Ink</code></a>. At the end of the day (after a bit of css and javascript) this award can be included in the page:
</p>

<ink-code>
&lt;cv-award
    title="UBC Library Innovative Dissemination of Research Award"
    description="Awarded for the SimPEG framework and community development"
    amount=1000.0
    level="institutional"
    date="2016"
    url="/innovative-dissemination-award-simpeg"
&gt;&lt;/cv-award&gt;
</ink-code>


<h2>Components are bricks!</h2>
<p>When we render this component in <code>html</code>, it looks like:</p>
<center>~~~~</center>
<cv-award
    title="UBC Library Innovative Dissemination of Research Award"
    description="Awarded for the SimPEG framework and community development"
    amount=1000.0
    level="institutional"
    date="2016"
    url="/innovative-dissemination-award-simpeg"
></cv-award>
<center>~~~~</center>

<p>
    Each <emph>brick</emph> (component, artifact, thing) is completely stand-alone, so I can have a rather <a href="/scholarship-ubc-simpeg">boring page</a> that shows that CV item all by itself. <ink-aside>I am calling these components <code>bricks</code>, because there is <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/142/3590/339.1.long" target="_blank">Chaos in the Brickyard</a>.</ink-aside> I should also eventually add a REST or GraphQL API so that you can load these up client side or query them from somewhere else. This would ultimately allow for the visualization at the start of this post - or much more importantly <strong>imports</strong> of content into a page. By that I mean:
    <br><code>&lt;brick-import src="/api/v1/scholarship-ubc-simpeg"&gt;&lt;/brick-import&gt;</code><br>
    Which could be added to an existing article, this is of course where things get really interesting. However, before we get there I want to explore a bit more about how you can combine these into various different pages.
</p>


<h2>Composing pages</h2>

<p>
    These "bricks" are stand-alone contributions, however, to give them context they need to be embedded in other pages, which means you need to find them programmatically. Each <code>brick</code> should have a persistent unique identifier (<code>uid</code>) so I can query it either directly or search for similar content - currently I am using a human readable <emph>slug</emph>. Also, right now my "database" is the file system and my caching layer is a python dictionary - the height of sophistication, and ready for production use (clearly).
</p>

<h3>Query</h3>

<p>
    I should probably look more into <a href="http://graphql.org/learn/" target="_blank">GraphQL</a> here, because that community has actually given some thought on how to structure queries - regardless of your database implementation. It is similar in principle to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data" target="_blank">Linked Data</a> as it defines a standard way to transfer data, and hosts its own schema/ontology in a discoverable way - but GraphQL is <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-rdf-schema-20140225/" target="_blank">more approachable (e.g. than RDF)</a> and seems to have slightly <a href="http://graphene-python.org/" target="_blank">better tooling</a> and documentation.
    <ink-aside>For example, query by <code>CvItems</code> that are featured and tagged as education.</ink-aside>
    However, to get up and running, I rolled my own <emph>Query Language-ish</emph> (really?!) that allows you to query by <code>kind</code>, <code>tag</code> or <code>uid</code> or a combination of these. This I have exposed as a series of collection classes.
</p>

<ink-code>
{
    "__class__": "CollectionItems",
    "title": "Awards",
    "description": "Collection of awards",
    "license": "CC-BY-4.0",
    "query_type": ["kind"],
    "query_kind": "CvAward",
    "uid": "collection-awards"
}
</ink-code>

<p>
    Similar to before, this <code>brick</code> can be <a href="/collection-awards">exposed independently</a> and in this case is a collection of all of my awards.
</p>

<h3>List</h3>

<p>
    Most pages will be slightly more specific about exactly how they should act - importing specific bricks (probably at specific versions). In this case, the page that provides context is <a href="curriculum-vitae">my CV</a>, which has a whole list of awards, education, experience and skills.
</p>

<ink-code>
{
    "__class__": "Collection",
    "uid": "curriculum-vitae",
    "title": "Curriculum Vitae",
    "description": "Rowan Cockett's Curriculum Vitae",
    "license": "CC-BY-4.0",
    "query_type": ["uid"],
    "thumbnail": "/images/rowan/requesting-to-join.png",
    "query_uids": [
        "cv-intro",
        "collection-education",
        "hr",
        "collection-experience",
        "hr",
        "collection-awards"
    ]
}
</ink-code>

<p>
    The link to my CV can be included on my <a href="/">home page</a>, which in turn is a query into this data source - featured thoughts, ideas, and contributions.
    In this example, I got sick of writing some of the very simple pieces, like a horizontal-rule <code>&lt;hr&gt;</code>, so I just made this into a reusable component. This is probably the silliest, most over-designed infrastructure to put four characters into an html page ever invented. Thankfully, this has other uses like <emph>importing ideas</emph>.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Importing ideas</h2>

<p>
    In the CV example, I have shown that you can break your document into a database and represent each line (almost) as an entry that can be queried or exposed in multiple ways (json, executable code, latex or html). These rather simple ideas lead to creating pages through composition of data sources rather than composition in the solely artistic sense. Above, there were commonly used bricks that emerged as I was writing. Some of these were solely for layout, however, some of these - especially when I was writing my phd - were more useful: figures, equations, sections of text.
</p>

<h3>Equation bank</h3>

<p>
    I have experimented with <a href="https://github.com/simpeg/equations">reusable equations</a> and the same idea for <a href="https://github.com/simpeg/figures">figures</a> in my thesis. This is difficult to actually do in practice, and my thesis git repository had to have complex pointers to all of the dependencies. A paper I wrote that referenced these equations inevitably ends up on a different version of the equation, it is a bit intricate to stay organized - very possible - but easier to copy and paste.
    <ink-aside>I used <a href="https://github.com/aranzgeo/git-project">Git Project</a> to keep track of specific links to commit hashes and repositories.</ink-aside>
    I intended to have these equations used by the <a href="/simpeg">SimPEG community</a>, but the uptake was ~0, although  enthusiasm was notoriously high (<a href="https://twitter.com/leouieda/status/824316659779469312">7 likes, wooo!</a> ha). In the <a href="/geosci">GeoSci community</a>, however, the development of ideas is necessarily more collaborative and for consistency of equations across the entire resource of interconnected pages, it was worth the time to invest in an <a href="https://em.geosci.xyz/content/equation_bank.html">equation bank</a>. This allows us to debate and invest time in notation, which <a href="/on-breakthroughs">is important</a>. The equation bank is a list of equations with correct notation, and expose these to the entire GeoSci not-a-textbook textbook.
    For example, pulling from the article on <a href="https://em.geosci.xyz/content/maxwell1_fundamentals/formative_laws/lenz.html" target="_blank">Lenz's Law</a> we can see that the equations are dynamically <code>include</code>d - the <a href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html" target="_blank">restructured text</a> equivalent of an import statement.
</p>

<ink-code language="text">
A convenient way to quantify the strength of the magnetic field in a
particular region is the magnetic flux (:math:`\Phi_{\mathbf{B}}`),

which provides a measure of the magnetic flux density over a given area.

.. include:: ../../equation_bank/faraday_lenz_time.rst
</ink-code>

<p>
    I also used the idea of an equation bank in <a href="/phd-thesis">my thesis</a> written in <code>latex</code>, this allowed me to import equations:
    <br><code>\input{equations/something-horrendous}</code><br>
    which magically creates a

</ink-equation>

<p>
    I can use this equation in <a href="/phd-thesis">my thesis</a>, <a href="/richards-paper">my paper</a>, and <a href="/static/richards-equation/index.html#/9">presentations</a> - and know that it is correct! Which it never is, so you can just <a href="https://github.com/simpeg/equations/commit/f0b65615b64a06df8093a0893f01424b489fb249#diff-ae1889936116cd0a2e12974f31ba3665" target="_blank">release a new version</a> - and update things, because you didn't copy and paste. By using an equation bank, we can discuss syntax and <a href="https://em.geosci.xyz/content/maxwell1_fundamentals/quick_guide_maxwell.html#variables-and-units" target="_blank">define the meaning of the variables</a> and <a href="https://github.com/csdms/standard_names/blob/master/standard_names/data/names-0.8.5.txt" target="_blank">standardize our naming</a> of variables.
    <ink-aside>
        These common resources are referred to as the <a href="https://www.force11.org/group/scholarly-commons-working-group" target="_blank">Scholarly Commons</a>, which has <a href="https://www.force11.org/scholarly-commons/principles" target=_blank>principles</a> and sketches at <a href="https://youtu.be/o4nUe-6Ln-8?t=8m19s" target="_blank">infrastructure</a>.
    </ink-aside>
    However, if we copy and paste, it isn't worth putting any effort into making an equation any good if you are only going to use it once. If we build it up as common resource, you can invest in them.
</p>

<h3>It's all just math...</h3>
<p>
    For example, if we had a true equation bank - maybe we could invest more in showing our readers the derivation of an equation. We could have a <a href="https://em.geosci.xyz/content/maxwell1_fundamentals/quick_guide_maxwell.html#variables-and-units" target="_blank">look up table</a> for our variables with links to more work. Or see where this equation is used throughout our work.
</p>

<ink-callout>
    Try clicking the DC resistivity equation below to see a <a href="/pixels-and-their-neighbors">full derivation</a>. Can't do that in a pdf.
</ink-callout>

<div id="dc-equation" style="cursor: pointer;" onclick="document.getElementById('dc-equation').setAttribute('hidden', true);document.getElementById('dc-figure').removeAttribute('hidden');" title="Click to see derivation.">
    <ink-equation>
        \nabla \cdot \sigma \left( - \nabla \phi \right) = q
    </ink-equation>
</div>
<div id="dc-figure" hidden style="cursor: pointer;" onclick="document.getElementById('dc-figure').setAttribute('hidden', true);document.getElementById('dc-equation').removeAttribute('hidden');">
    <ink-figure src="/images/finite-volume/dc-equations.png">
        The derivation of the DC resistivity equations.
    </ink-figure>
</div>

<p>
    When actually writing, the annoying part is that you never just copy the equation in directly, it has to be changed via notation and isolation of variables. But heck, because we invested in an equation bank this is trivial right?!
</p>

<ink-code>
&lt;ink-equation
    src="/api/v1/dc-resistivity-eqn"
    substitute='{"sigma": "\frac{1}{\rho}"}'
    isolate="phi"
&gt;&lt;/ink-equation&gt;
</ink-code>

<p>
    This would obviously substitute out variables and use <a href="http://www.sympy.org/" target="_blank">SymPy</a> to isolate the variable $\phi$ dynamically. Some of this work is ... not quite done yet. Stay tuned! However, I have wrapped up <a href="https://khan.github.io/KaTeX/" target="_blank">Katex</a> in a web component, because MathJax is slooooow (<a href="https://www.intmath.com/cg5/katex-mathjax-comparison.php" target=_blank>63ms vs 1048ms</a>).

<h2>On collaboration</h2>

<p>
    One of my favorite talks is one that Lindsey Heagy gave at SciPy 2016 on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IW2LDsevvDk" target="_blank">Refactoring Geoscience Education</a> where she presented some of these ideas using the analogy of programming and open source.
    How do we go from copy-paste, serial, scientific writing to something that is a bit more ... modern and inspired. We gave a follow up at <a href="/jupytercon2017">JupyterCon in 2017</a>. There are a lot of ideas in here, and I will unpack them later. The important piece is that these components (equations, CvItems, and figures) should be able to be imported through some sort of Distributed Idea Registry <ink-aside>The <emph>Distributed Idea Registry</emph>, kinda like <a href="https://www.windows-commandline.com/dir-command-line-options/" target="_blank"><code>dir</code></a>, but for all the ideas.</ink-aside> system. Why? The hard ideas require collaboration.
</p>

<ink-quote author="Mike Loukides" src="https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/what-is-jupyter" date="June 20, 2017">
    If all important work is collaborative, the most important tools we have are tools for collaboration, tools that make working together more productive.
</ink-quote>

<p>
    I wrote my whole thesis and most of my papers in Google Docs mostly because the collaboration that Docs offers is better than anything else. In these documents, we can strip out most of the latex to produce equations and figures into small, targeted files that are tracked independently. This allows us to use a collaborative document editor to do what it is good at.
</p>
<ink-figure src="/images/website/collaboration.png">
    Each sentence is edited by multiple people. All of this is lost when we compile to Latex.
</ink-figure>
<p>
    The real-time editing means that most sentences are written by multiple people, and the commenting system allows us to sidestep the formal scientific prose and have a more human conversation on the side while we figure out what we are trying to say.
</p>
<ink-figure src="/images/website/comments.png">
    The comment stream on choosing a single word is long and collaborative as we try to articulate what we actually mean.

<h3>Attribution over plagiarism</h3>

<p>
    It is really hard to communicate complex ideas, this is the main reason beyond vanity that <a href="/on-ideas-and-pencils">ideas need attribution</a>. These ideas, comments, nuances, references, citations are important to record, however, the final published version of a <del>blog post</del> scientific article are supposed to show you the just the final articulation, and a handful of potentially unresolvable links to previous works. However, maybe it would be nice if we didn't loose all this context and discussion?
    Traditional citations are big and clunky. By <emph>big</emph> I mean they can't point to a paragraph, figure, or character. These citations can't tell you, dear reader, <emph>why</emph> I cited that silly paper - maybe the <a href="/on-research"><code>{"reason": "Just to please Reviewer #2"}</code></a>. By <emph>clunky</emph> I mean by the time I have flipped to the bibliography, Googled the citation, logged in to my university VPN, remembered my password, got past the publishers pay wall, and downloaded the PDF - I have completely forgotten why this paper was even important.
</p>

<ink-figure src="/images/website/ink-cite.gif">
    We still need the traditional citations, but these are clumsy. Why do I have to cite a whole paper, <a href="https://twitter.com/worrydream/status/534807749029142529" target="_blank">instead of a single paragraph</a>?

<h2>Why this matters?</h2>

<p>
    If you are just making a website for yourself - this is probably the worst idea. You should look to your favorite static site generator and host it on github pages or similar. However, if you are trying to think about how to coordinate the collaborative development of ideas, <a href="/geosci">scientific text books</a>, or <a href="/pixels-and-their-neighbors">articles</a> and you want to capture attribution of the development and inspiration of the ideas in a more sophisticated way than a unresolvable text-only citation that is non-specific as to why you even are citing it.
