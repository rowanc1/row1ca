<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
 Fluid flow in the vadose zone is governed by Richards equation; it is parameterized by hydraulic conductivity, which is a nonlinear function of pressure head. Investigations in the vadose zone typically require characterizing distributed hydraulic properties. Saturation or pressure head data may include direct measurements made from boreholes. Increasingly, proxy measurements from hydrogeophysics are being used to supply more spatially and temporally dense data sets. Inferring hydraulic parameters from such datasets requires the ability to efficiently solve and deterministically optimize the nonlinear time domain Richards equation. This is particularly important as the number of parameters to be estimated in a vadose zone inversion continues to grow. In this paper, we describe an efficient technique to invert for distributed hydraulic properties in 1D, 2D, and 3D. Our algorithm does not store the Jacobian, but rather computes the product with a vector, which allows the size of the inversion problem to become much larger than methods such as finite difference or automatic differentiation; which are constrained by computation and memory, respectively. We show our algorithm in practice for a 3D inversion of saturated hydraulic conductivity using saturation data through time. The code to run our examples is open source and the algorithm presented allows this inversion process to run on modest computational resources.

    If we used a finite difference
    algorithm to explicitly calculate each of the $1.125 \times 10^5$ columns of the Jacobian with a
    simple forward difference, we would require a calculation for each model parameter -
    or approximately <strong>8.5 years of computational time</strong>. Furthermore, we would need to
    recompute the Jacobian at each iteration of the optimization algorithm. In contrast, if
    we use the implicit sensitivity algorithm presented in this paper, we can solve the entire
    inverse problem in <strong>34.5 hours</strong>.

    For example, on a $128 \times 128 \times 128$ mesh, the explicit formation of the
    sensitivity requires 419 GB for five spatially distributed model parameters, which is
    five times the requirement for a single distributed model parameter (83.9 GB). For the
    implicit sensitivity on the same mesh, only 4.09 GB of memory is required, which is
    1.2 times the requirement for a single distributed model parameter (3.54 GB).
