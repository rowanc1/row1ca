    Several high-quality application-specific geophysical inversion packages exist, however, combining these to integrate all available geophysical data is cumbersome and inefficient. This hinders experimentation and dissemination of new geophysical inversion methods. One of the root causes of this problem is the lack of consistent, well-tested building blocks that are shared between geophysical applications; this prevents researchers from efficiently combining numerical methodologies and heuristics. SimPEG is our attempt at solving some of these problems, by organizing many different geophysical methods into a <a href="/simpeg-paper">consistent framework</a>. This effort aims to accelerate new research in applied geophysics, and is implemented in a manner that facilitates experimentation by researchers. Researchers must be able to augment the geophysical inversion and modelling framework, visualize data and results, and apply their methodology to real data-sets that use <a href="/richards-paper">large-scale computations</a>. To advance the field, the development of heuristics and new methodologies must be captured in a form that can be reproduced, disseminated, and built upon by others.
