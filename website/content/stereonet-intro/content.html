<h1>Stereonet Tutorials and Apps</h1>
<p>For a long time I have wanted to do an interactive lesson on how to plot planes and lines on a stereonet. I finally gave it a go, the interface is very simple, and should lend itself well to extending this to some other tutorials.</p>
<p>The tutorials are:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="/stereonet-tutorial-plane">Plotting a line on a stereonet</a></li>
    <li><a href="/stereonet-tutorial-line">Plotting a line on a stereonet</a></li>
    <li><a href="/stereonet-tutorial-intersection">Finding the intersection between two planes.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
    I gave 10 very short points on how to plot planes and lines (one of them is Enjoy!), please give feedback if you think any are unclear to a beginner!
    I think the best part about this tutorial is that it goes into 3D at one point, where you can pause, and really get an idea of what that plane means by dragging it around yourself.
</p>
<ink-callout>Note that this is by no means a new idea (!) and many other people have written animations to show how to plot planes. Although, this might be the first one that is interactive in 3D!</ink-callout>
