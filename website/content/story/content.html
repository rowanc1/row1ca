I am interested in the intersection of education, industry, and academia, and seeing what happens when you make powerful scientific modelling, visualization and communication tools accessible through the web.
To explore these ideas, I founded <a href="/3point">3point Science</a> where we build web-based visualization software for the geoscience industry. 3point Science was acquired by Aranz Geo in 2016, and I have remained on as the CTO. I am also a graduate student at The University of British Columbia (Canada) where I am researching a numerical framework aimed at increasing quantitative communication in the geosciences. This framework has been developed through my studies on numerical geophysics, subsurface flow, and structural geology. Much of my research is accessible through an open-source software initiative for geophysical simulations and parameter estimation (http://simpeg.xyz) and an open website for geoscience modelling (http://visiblegeology.com).
