<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
    Computer based learning tools are becoming more prevalent in classrooms from elementary school to higher education. The potential value of interactive learning tools is particularly high in geoscience education where students can benefit from interactive tools that allow individuals to explore different processes in 1D, 2D, and 3D space. Traditionally, geoscience education has relied on laboratory exercises to provide students with the opportunity to explore dimensionality. In this paper we introduce Visible Geology, an innovative web?based application designed for geoscience education. Visible Geology enables visualization of geologic structures and processes through the use of interactive 3D models. As Visible Geology has been designed from a student?centric perspective, it has resulted in a simple and intuitive interface allowing students to creatively explore concepts. We present a case study of a large first year class at The University of British Columbia, and show the utility of Visible Geology in teaching geoscience concepts of relative geologic time and crosscutting relationships. The ease of use of the assignment, including automatic assessment, made this tool practical for deployment in classrooms of any size. The outcome of this type of large?scale deployment is that students, who would normally not experience a lab exercise, gain exposure to 3D thinking. The level of ownership and interactivity inherent in Visible Geology encourages engagement, leading learners to practice visualization and interpretation skills and discover geologic relationships.

<h2>Favorite Parts</h2>
<blockquote>
    Developing a creative experience for learners requires designing instructional materials that can be scaled back to cover any other sort of visualization tool.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    The interactive and modular nature of Visible Geology allows it to be tailored for many unique situations. It is not passive visualization, it promotes creation, integration and discovery.
